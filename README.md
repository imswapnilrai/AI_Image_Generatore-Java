AI Image Generating Android App using OpenAI API
The AI Image Generating Android App is a user-friendly mobile application that harnesses the power of AI to generate images from textual inputs using the OpenAI API. This app serves as an example of how AI can be integrated into Android applications to create visual content from descriptive text prompts.

Note: Before you begin, make sure you have an OpenAI API key. You can sign up for access to the OpenAI API on their official website.

Features:
Text-to-Image Conversion: Users can enter descriptive text prompts, and the app will use the OpenAI API to generate corresponding images.
Interactive Interface: The app provides a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to input text prompts and view the generated images.
Exploration: Users can experiment with various text prompts to observe the different images generated by the AI model.



Usage
Build and run the app using Android Studio on an emulator or a physical Android device.
On the app's main screen, you'll find an input field where you can enter a descriptive text prompt.
After entering the text prompt, tap the "Generate Image" button.
The app will communicate with the OpenAI API using the provided text prompt and display the generated image on the screen.
You can repeat the process with different text prompts to observe how the AI generates various images based on your inputs.
